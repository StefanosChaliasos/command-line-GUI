    "NAME" : "ls -- list directory contents",

    "SYNOPSIS" : "ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]",

    "DESCRIPTION" : "For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information. If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.",

The -B, -b, -w, and -q options all override each other; the last one specified determines the format used for non-printable characters. The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or fully); they are applied in the order specified. By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are specified.
